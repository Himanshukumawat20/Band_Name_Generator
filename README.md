# Band Name Generator

Welcome to the Band Name Generator! This simple Python script prompts users to input their city name and pet's name and then combines them to generate a unique band name.

## How to Use

1. Run the script: 
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
   - Run the script by typing `Band_Name_Generator` and press Enter.

2. Follow the prompts:
   - When prompted, enter the city you grew up in.
   - Then, enter the name of your pet.

3. Get your band name:
   - Once you've provided both inputs, the script will generate your band name and display it on the screen.
